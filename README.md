## Introduction

In this project, we utilized SQL queries to perform basic, intermediate, and advanced analysis on pizza sales data. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior, sales patterns, and market trends within the pizza industry.

## Data

The dataset comprises several Excel files including:
- `order_details.xlsx`
- `orders.xlsx`
- `pizza_types.xlsx`
- `pizzas.xlsx`

These files contain essential information such as order details, customer demographics, pizza types, and more.

## Queries

We've implemented a variety of SQL queries to address different analytical objectives, including:
- Basic queries for retrieving total orders, revenue, and identifying popular pizza types.
- Intermediate analysis to determine peak ordering times, category-wise distribution, and average pizzas per day.
- Advanced queries for assessing revenue contribution, cumulative revenue over time, and top-performing pizza types within each category.

## Analysis

Our analysis dives deep into the data, exploring sales trends, customer preferences, and business performance metrics. By leveraging SQL, we've uncovered actionable insights that can inform strategic decision-making and drive business growth.
